synopsis:
  -
    Web3 Summit is organized around a single rallying call; to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web.
  -
    Every year the devs and researchers working on lower level protocols and others interested in the latest developments in the decentralized web come together for an immersive and collaborative gathering focusing on the Web3 technology stack, including P2P protocols. Platform neutral computation language. Data distribution protocols. Blockchains. Transient data/messaging. Encrypted storage. Protocol-extensible developer APIs.
  -
    Web3 Summit is an open and collaborative space where the community can create their own programming. Web3 Foundation invites a full line up of high quality speakers, while individuals, teams and projects use the rest of the space for workshops, presentations, AMA sessions â€“ both intimate and large-scale, chilling, and most importantly, hacking. There will always be a large room dedicated to a hackerspace, where you can host a meetup or hackathon, whiteboard some ideas, present to other teams, and get real work done. This is your Summit, so program it how you want!
